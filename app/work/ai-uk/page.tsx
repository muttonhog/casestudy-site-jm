          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            AI UK is the Alan Turing Institute’s flagship public conference,
            bringing together researchers, industry, policymakers and the wider
            public to explore the real-world impact of data science and AI.
            Hosted at the QEII Centre in London, it is one of the most visible and
            high-profile events the Institute delivers.

          <h2>The challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge was to create a coherent, high-quality body of video
            content across a multi-day live event — balancing clarity,
            accessibility and accuracy while working with senior speakers,
            complex topics, and a live audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work needed to function across multiple contexts: live stream,
            on-demand viewing, short-form social, and longer-term institutional
            use — with no margin for error during delivery.

          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>
            I led all video content for AI UK, taking responsibility for the
            full lifecycle of onscreen output before, during and after the
            event.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creative and editorial direction for event video output</li>
            <li>Development of trailers, session assets and short documentaries</li>
            <li>Direction of live streams and on-site video crews</li>
            <li>Management of event capture and technical delivery</li>
            <li>Editing and publishing of full sessions and cutdowns</li>
            <li>Creation of social-first content to support promotion and reach</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The work</h2>
          <p>
            Across AI UK 2023 and 2025, I worked closely with communications,
            events and senior stakeholders to ensure that complex research and
            policy discussions were presented clearly and responsibly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Editorial decisions focused on accessibility, tone and audience
            trust — particularly when working with sensitive or contested
            topics such as AI ethics, algorithmic bias and emerging technologies.

          <h2>Outcome & learning</h2>
          <p>
            Leading video for AI UK sharpened my ability to make calm, confident
            editorial decisions under pressure. It reinforced the importance of
            preparation, clear roles, and trust when delivering live, highly
            visible content at scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project also demonstrated how long-form event content can be
            shaped into a coherent narrative that extends beyond the event
            itself, supporting ongoing engagement and understanding.
