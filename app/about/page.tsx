          I’m a UK-based Producer / Director with 15+ years’ experience creating digital-first
          video, audio and social content for broadcasters, brands and public institutions.

        <p>
          I lead digital-first content at the Alan Turing Institute, translating complex or
          sensitive topics into clear, accessible stories for public, industry and policy audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m comfortable owning work end-to-end: concept, production, publishing, analytics and
          iteration — with judgement and audience trust as the priority.
